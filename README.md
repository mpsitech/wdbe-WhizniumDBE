# WhizniumDBE

The Whiznium Device Builder's Edition, finally as Open Source Software project.

WhizniumDBE extends the concept of model-based source code generation to the world of FPGA's (and partially MCU's). On the Embedded Linux level, it generates access libraries which can be used independently of WhizniumSBE projects.

## Resources for now

### Use cases

- Whiznium StarterKit Device: Zynq (ARM and Xilinx FPGA) compatible VHDL code, with basic hardware control and 5 megapixel pipelined image processing. PolarFire SoC (RISC-V and Microchip FPGA) in the making. [Git repository](https://github.com/mpsitech/wskd-Whiznium-StarterKit-Device)

### Reference / documentation

- Documentation of model files (slightly outdated) as [Git repository](https://github.com/mpsitech/WhizniumDBE-docs)
- [.pdf slides](https://mpsitech-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/wdbe_templates.pdf) outlining various levels of module templatification using WhizniumDBE

### Marketing material

Most of these publications pre-date Whiznium's Open Source era.

## Upcoming documentation

- The Whiznium book (draft available [here](https://mpsitech-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/book.pdf)), offering an introduction to WhizniumSBE/DBE by means of a handy use case in the first chapters, but also with a complete reference in the later chapters
